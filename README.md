# Mad Libs Generator
This is a simple Mad Libs HTML generator that I made for Fanimad Libs using Angular.

**Q: What is Fanimad Libs?**

[Fanimad Libs](http://fanimadlibs.tumblr.com/) has been a comedy/game show panel at anime convention [FanimeCon](http://www.fanime.com/) in San Jose since 2012. It has also appeared at [Kraken Con](http://www.krakencon.com/) as well as [Nan Desu Kan](http://ndkdenver.org/) in Denver. We prepare our own anime-themed [Mad Libs](http://www.madlibs.com/) and then fill them out with the audience! Fanimad Libs is the brainchild of Sarah Port and Kate Densmore and we're working to make it a unique and fun experience every year.

**Q: Wow! That sounds cool. I want to host a Mad Libs panel at my local convention too!**

For inqiries on running this panel at your local convention, please contact us either here on github, via our [tumblr](http://fanimadlibs.tumblr.com/), or reach out via [email](sarahe.port@gmail.com).

## Getting Started

### Installation
Download the project and unzip the folder.

Inside the folder, open "index.html" in the browser of your choice (I recommend Chrome though).

### Generating Mad Libs
To use the mad libs generator, type your story into the leftmost text area. To insert a textarea, type the part of speech it should be surrounded by hard brackets, like so:

```
[adjective]
```

A preview will appear as you type on the right side of the screen, and you can copy and paste the source code from the middle.
